044-react hooks:
it allows to use react features without having to write a class eg:state of a component
cannot use hooks inside class
why hooks?
1st set:
difficult to use this keyword
remember to bind event handlers
classes dont minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable
2nd set:
there is no particular way to reuse stateful components logic
HOC and render props patterns address this problem, we have to wrap our component to other components
makes code harder to follow
ther is a need to share stateful logic in a better way
3rd set:
create components for complex scenerios such as data fetching and subscribing to EventSource, relates codes are not organized in one place 
eg: data fetching in componentDidMount and componentDIdUpdate
eg: event listeners in componentDidMount and componentWillmount
because of stateful logic we cannot break components into smaler ones

NB:
hooks dont contain many changes and is backward compatible
classes wont be removed from react

045- useState Hook-
useState is a hook that lets you add state to a react functional component
create a Component

initialize the state value OF COUNT TO ZERO
import usseState
then just call it 
it can  accepts an argument which is initial value of state property, returns current value of state property and a method capable of updating the stste property
uaing  array destruccturing we can accept the return value

change the state value using setState

rules for using hooks:
only call hooks at the top level
do not call hooks inside loops consitons or nested functions
only call hooks from react functions component

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

046 - useState with prevState-
changing state in hooks based on the prev state
if there is a buttom to increment the value by 5 we loop 5 times and call setCount(count+1) method 5 times to  get the value
the count will only increment by  one as we saw in class states
instead of passing the newstate variable pass a function that has acess to previous state
every time when we want t update the state value to a new state value use this methos
            setCount(prev=>prev+1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

047- useState with object-
with useState use object as a state variable
state varialbe can be anything a string a boolean anumber an array or an object
we are setting the first and last name as empty, so if we type firstname the last name is removed fromm the objet and vice vversa
useState doent automatically merge or update the object. this is the key differrence to setstate
setstate will merge the state whereas usestate donot merge the state you have too do it manually
use spread operator to handle the manual merge
      <input type='text' name='firstName' value={name.firstName} onChange={e=>setName({...name,firstName: e.target.value})}/>
this will copy evrything in the name object and then just overwrites the ones that have Changed 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

048 - useState with array:
incase of array useState wont automatically append item to the array
we need to do it manually using spread operator
    const addItem = ()=>{
        setArray([...items,{
            id: items.length,
            value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) +1
        }])
    }
